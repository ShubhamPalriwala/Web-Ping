# Web-Ping

Here, I've created a Backend for an e-commerce website as my Cyber Security project for ISOC 2020 by [IEEE-VIT](https://www.ieeevit.org ).

I'd like to thank my Mentor Ajmal Shaik without whom this might have not been possible.

This is a python CLI tool to figure out which domains are active from a list of domains taking input in the form of a text file

Add all the websites you want to test in thw websites.txt file\
And then in the terminal, run the following code:\
python run tool.py\
The Command line will display all the website and will let you know whether the websites are up and running or not.
